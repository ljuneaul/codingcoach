# Coding coach assignments for mentees

## Purpose of the repo
I'm currently mentoring a few people on [Coding Coach](https://codingcoach.io/).
I created this repo to gather a few assignments for the mentees to work on.

## How it works
I will provide all the requirements and technical info on the README of each
assignment.

You should:
* [x] Create a board on https://trello.com/ and invite me (through private message 
on slack/skype). This will help you stay organized and will allow me to see how
you organise yourself and divide tasks.
* [x] Fork this repo
* [ ] Go to the project folder and work on it (Do not add files to the root folder where this README is)
  1) fork the assignment repo (my github, coding coach repo)
  2) clone that repo to your local machine
  3) `git checkout -b <name_of_your_branch>`
  4) do some work, commit and push (can be several commits/pushes)
      - `git push original name_of_current_branch`
      - or, right after made new branch,
      
        `git push --set-upstream origin name_of_new_branch`
        
        `git push`
  5) once you push, go to you github and open a pull request (pressing a button)
  
      **Make sure it's pulling to MINE not the original!**
    
  6) I review your PR and approve/reject
  7) local, go to master, pull
  8) repeat 3~7
  9) you merge it after it all ends
* [ ] Instructions for the assignment will be on the README inside the assignments's folder.

*NOTES*
* You will NOT push to this repo, you will work on your forked repository.
* DO **NOT push to your repo directly**
* You should create a new branch and then open a *PULL REQUEST* to merge your branch into your `master` branch.
* After that you should send me the url so I can review it. This will allow me to help you on every commit. You can also add me as a contributor so I can freely merge/block PR's.

## Instructions unclear?
Please send me a message on skype/slack so I can update the README.
